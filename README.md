# snippets

- `docker` contains a dockerfile that I am including because using multi-stage build decreased the image size by about 500MB
- `integrators` contains a python module that creates certain time integrators used in a side project for an n-body simulator.
- `metaclass` contains a small program I made to familiarize myself with python's metaclasses. It is inspired by pydantic and uses metaclasses to create validated dataclasses. The tests can be run with `poetry install && poetry run pytest`.
